# IT202-008
Course: IT202-008 
Edie Westrich -Edie is short for Meredith/Edith, which is why my UCID isn't ew396 lol
I'm a third year IT major, but I switched from CS last semester- I'm enjoying
it a lot more which is cool! I haven't decided on a concentration because I'm
kind of interested in everything IT has to offer! I'm looking forward to this
class and learning more basics :)
